Create two new websites, port 8888 and port 8080, and modify the corresponding directory
Modify the ip of serverlist.xml under the 8888 folder. This file must be utf-8 encoded

apk modification

010editor opens to find Unicode
139.196.32.250 replaces the IP

Port open 8080 8888 12020-12050
Telecom broadband cannot access 8080. Modify the so 8080 of the apk to 8081, and then map 8081 from the external network of the router to 8080 of the internal network.

When the apk enters the game and exits for the first time, it cannot enter. Clear the data and cache of the app and you can enter. I donâ€™t know what the problem is.
